# easy-nuxt-resume

This project is based on the [nuxt-resume project](https://github.com/ivangreve) made by [Iván Greve](https://github.com/ivangreve).

This provides a **simple, free** (for up to 1 year) way to launch your own web resume, on [Amazon Web Services (AWS)](https://aws.amazon.com/). using Iván's VueJs template. We'll use infrastructure-as-code (IAC) to quickly and automatically serve it.

**WORK IN PROGRESS**
